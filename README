A bot that reads SMS messages from a google voice account then runs commands based off those messages.
It uses Java Reflection to load methods at run-time from the .class files in the 'addons' folder to
allow for functionality to be added without having to recompile the source files each time.

The config.ini file contains the google voice username and password for the account you wish to use.

Tick rate is an integer which determines the time in milliseconds between SMS reads. The higher this is,
the less resources the bot will take.
